# Python CLI timer

My wife asked me to check green beans in 10 minutes, so as a nerd I made a simple timer. Beans got overcooked.

## Installation

```{shell}
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/jakubnowicki/timer@master
```

## Usage

```{shell}
timer --help              show help
timer 30                  count 30 seconds
timer 10 --unit=minute    count 10 minutes
```
